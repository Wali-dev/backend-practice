The MVC arch. is a method for building the backend of a web application.
MVC stands for Models View Controller 
The main idea of this concept is to seperately building components of the web app
 for scalability, easy understandability and simple debugging.

In this architecture we make diffrent javascript file to handle routes, their controlling, their models, and views which delivers the static html and css file for out app.

From now on, all of my practice will be following this architecture.
